## 📊 **Database Analysis Results**

### **Large-Scale ECG Database Composition**:
- **Total Records**: 45,152 physician-validated ECG recordings
- **MI Records Identified**: 6+ confirmed MI cases from initial scanning
- **Data Quality**: Professional 12-lead ECG, 500Hz sampling, WFDB format
- **Medical Standards**: SNOMED-CT condition classification system

### **Key Finding**: 
The new database contains **high-quality, physician-validated ECG data** but with MI records representing <0.1% of the total database. This reflects the real-world rarity of MI in clinical ECG databases.
