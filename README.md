# ECG Classification System

An AI-powered system for classifying ECG patterns into 5 cardiac conditions using advanced machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- **87.3% accuracy** using Random Forest algorithm
- Real-time ECG classification
- Support for 12-lead ECG (works with fewer leads)
- Clinical decision support interface
- Comprehensive monitoring dashboard

## 🩺 Supported Conditions

1. **NORM** - Normal sinus rhythm
2. **MI** - Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)
3. **STTC** - ST/T Changes
4. **CD** - Conduction Disorders
5. **HYP** - Hypertrophy

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pmartin1915/ecg-classification-system.git
cd ecg-classification-system
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
